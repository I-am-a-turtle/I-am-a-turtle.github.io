### The Basics

My name is Grace Mazzarella, Williams Class of 2019. I got hooked on Computer Science during fall of my second year, when I took Duane's computer graphics class and Brent's CS 135 (now also 134?) simultaneously.

When I'm not doing school-related things, I am the head choreographer of Williams College Asian Dance Troupe, and an active member and choreographer for CoDa, the Williams College Contemporary Dance Company. I work in the '62 Center's costume shop, and am decent with a needle and thread.
